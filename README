if you have played D&D, you know that is filled with spell lists.
you have to manage them, choosing every day which spell you want to
prepare, or what spell you want to learn when you gain a new level.

You Have to read the various player's manuals, use indexes , search the full descriptions, 
third party recollections (often incomplete or wrong), etc etc.

This project, when finished, will be a fully featured manager, that will let you
maintain your own spell list. Quickly add new spells, filter them, print them,
or any other action that might be useful.

You will be able to print a full list of cleric spells or to
simplify the selection of which spells to order a particular day, or manage 
your wizard spell-book, from which you will choose which spells to 
prepare that morning, or make a simple list off all the spells your
sorcerer knows

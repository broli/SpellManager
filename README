if you have played D&D, you know that is filled with spell lists.
you have to manage them, choosing every day which spell you want to
prepare, or what spell you want to learn when you gain a new level.

The worst and best part of this system, is haveing to read the various
player's manuals, using indexes, searching the full descriptions, ect ect.

The intention of this proyect, is the creation of (at least one) application
that will help you with that.
The first step, is to make an application that will help you enter the
details of a spell, and store it. Hopefully step 2 will involve a usefull
way of printing said list.

In the end, you will be able to print a full list of cleric spells, to
simplyfy selection which spells to order a particular day, or keep and 
manage your wizard spellbook, from wich you will choose which spells to 
prepare that morning, or make a simple list off all the spells your
sorcerer knows
